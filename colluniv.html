        <h2>Welcome to Live 12</h2>
        <p>Teaching with Live gives students everything they need to make unlimited progress on their chosen path. Millions of music and audio professionals choose Live for its built-in instruments, effects and creative features that continue to spark new ideas and ways of working. Live 12 comes with even more teaching opportunities – new techniques and experimental tools, brought together in a flexible environment that supports all learning styles and keeps students focused on creating.</p>
        <img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/components/text-beside-media/Ableton_ICMP_Retouch_OBTikare_2024-13_Crop.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=1920" alt="">
        <h2>Teach new techniques</h2>
        <h3>MIDI Transformations</h3>
        <p>Introduce inventive new ways to rearrange, randomize and time warp MIDI patterns to inspire variations and put theory into practice.</p>

        <h3>MIDI Generators</h3>
        <p>Conjure up quick ideas – melodies, chords and rhythms to get students of all levels out of the loop and into a composing mindset.</p>
        <h3>Tuning systems</h3>
        <p>Demonstrate a rich variety of music traditions outside of the Western 12-tone system, and use Scale Awareness to shape sounds and effects in key.</p>

        <h2>Encourage experiments</h2>
        <h3>Roar</h3>
        <p>Teach experimental sound design techniques with Live’s new coloring and saturation device with a built-in compressor section for detailed adjustment.</p>

        <h3>Meld</h3>
        <p>Explore a vast selection of complex oscillators to load into Meld’s dual engines, and illustrate deep modulation by re-routing and combining them in different ways.</p>

        <h3>Performance Pack</h3>
        <p>Prepare your students for the stage with customizable devices that grant more comprehensive control over their Sets, making live performance more intuitive and fun.</p>

        <h3>Max for Live MIDI Tools</h3>
        <p>Let students experiment even further by creating their own MIDI Tools in Max for Live, either based on tweaks to existing devices or built entirely from scratch.</p>

        <h2>Focus on creating</h2>
        <h3>Sound Similarity Search</h3>
        <p>Spend less time scrolling through samples – help your students find the sounds they want to use and learn how to match them.</p>

        <h3>Accessibility improvements</h3>
        <p>Develop a more inclusive curriculum for all kinds of learners, and explore different ways to play with Live.

        <h2>Get hands on with Push</h2>
        <p>Students can also learn the fundamentals of digital composition in a more instrumental context with Push, Ableton’s hardware instrument. With hands-on control of rhythm, sounds and song structure and a uniquely creative approach to melody and harmony, Push puts the building blocks of music-making at a student’s fingertips.</p>
        <img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/components/text-beside-media/Ableton_ICMP_Retouch_OBTikare_2024-16_Crop.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=1920" alt="">
        <h2>Play, create and perform</h2>
        <h3>Standalone playability</h3>
        <p>Push invites you to disconnect and be fully in the moment with your music. Send your Live sets to Push to work without a computer, then back again.</p>

        <h3>MPE-enabled pads</h3>
        <p>Shape your sound with pads that respond to the slightest movement of your fingers. Bend, slide and shift between different notes, sounds and articulations.</p>
        <h3>Built-in audio interface</h3>
        <p>Plug your instruments into Push’s own audio interface to record straight into your set. Plus, send CV and gate signals to your modular setup.</p>

        <h3>Live set transfer</h3>
        <p>Anything you make using Push in Standalone Mode can be transferred to your computer over WiFi, and opened in Live.</p>

        <h2>Teach with Move</h2>
        <p>Move’s compact size, straightforward workflow and huge library of Ableton-quality sounds make it the ideal creative companion for the classroom.</p>
        <p>For teachers, Move is easy to use and teach with thanks to its simple, minimal design. Students can quickly create ideas, mix and match them to develop their own unique sound, and achieve exciting breakthroughs. Plus, Move’s portability means they can keep the momentum going outside of the classroom.</p>
        <img src="https://ableton-production.imgix.net/components/text-beside-media/Edu-img2.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=1920" alt="">
        <h2>A portable tool for intuitive music making</h2>
        <h3>Four tracks, thousands of sounds</h3>
        <p>Move’s four tracks can be turned into a drum kit, sampler or instrument in seconds, so students can skip the lengthy onboarding and start making music right away.</p>

        <h3>Tactile control</h3>
        <p>Move’s 32 soft silicone pads let students play notes, create beats and trigger clips, and its touch-sensitive rotary encoders make it easy to tweak each sound and effect to taste.</p>

        <h3>Capture, connect and create</h3>
        <p>Teach sampling with Move’s built-in microphone. Have a quick listen to your students’ work with the integrated speaker, or plug in headphones to limit classroom noise.</p>

        <h3>Continue in Live</h3>
        <p>When your students are ready to refine their work, they can easily transfer their Sets to Live with the help of Move Manager and Ableton Cloud.</p>
